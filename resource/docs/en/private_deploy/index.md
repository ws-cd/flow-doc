# Localized Deployment
{: .no_toc .header }

----
If you need to deploy the service to your own private server or local, you can refer to the following tutorial.
 
## Get the latest image

Use the following command to obtain the latest installation image. Before obtaining the latest image, please confirm that [the latest docker service has been installed](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

```shell
docker pull registry.cn-chengdu.aliyuncs.com/zpcloud/zbot-aio:latest
```
## Start Container

### Start service without GPU
After obtaining the latest image, if you do not use the GPU, you can start the service with the following command
```shell

docker run --name zbot --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway -v /usr/local/zbot/.promptai/:/usr/local/zbot/.promptai/:rw -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock  -v <host-path-log>:/data/logs -v <host-path-mysql>:/data/mysql -v <host-path-mongo>:/data/mongo -v <host-path-p8s>:/data/minimalzp/p8s -p hostport:80  registry.cn-chengdu.aliyuncs.com/zpcloud/zbot-aio:latest


```
<br/>explain:
- `/var/run/docker.sock`: Docker Communication file (the service communicates with the docker to manage the model container)ã€‚
- `/usr/local/zbot/.promptai/`: The training file cache directory needs to be consistent with the following mapping directory. If you need to modify it, you need to add the parameter ` - e ai. base. dir=<path>- v<path>:<path>`, `<path>` as the directory you need to modify
- `<host-path-log>`: Log save directory
- `<host-path-mysql>`: MySQL data file directory
- `<host-path-mongo>`: Mongodb data file directory
- `<host-path-p8s>`: Minimalzp data directory
- `hostport`: The service exposed port cannot be occupied by other programs

### Start the service using the GPU
If you need to use the GPU, please install the GPU driver first. Currently, only the 'nvidia' video card is supported. [Driver download link](https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-container-runtime/)

```shell
# Check whether the drive is normal
nvidia-smi
```
As shown in the figure after the drive is installed normally

Start the service and use the GPU. All GPUs of the current computer are used by default. If you need to specify GPUs, please refer to [the documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#access-an-nvidia-gpu)
```shell
# Use GPU

docker run --name zbot --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway -v /usr/local/zbot/.promptai/:/usr/local/zbot/.promptai/:rw -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock  -v <host-path-log>:/data/logs -v <host-path-mysql>:/data/mysql -v <host-path-mongo>:/data/mongo -v <host-path-p8s>:/data/minimalzp/p8s -p hostport:80 --gpus all registry.cn-chengdu.aliyuncs.com/zpcloud/zbot-aio:latest

```

### Installation is complete
After the command is executed, we can see the address, account and password information, as shown in the figure:

```shell
# Check the container log to determine whether the service was started successfully

docker logs -f zbot
```

  ![deploy-01](/assets/images/private_deploy/deploy-01.png)

### Login experience
Use the address, account and password displayed after installation to open the experience, as shown in the figure:
  ![deploy-02](/assets/images/private_deploy/deploy-02.png)

<br/>Note: Default initial login account/password: admin@promptai.local /Promptai, but please refer to the display after the service installation is completed

## explain

### Model Container
When we debug and publish the project, the system will create (by starting a new docker container) the corresponding model container according to the published project. Each published project will correspond to a model container,All debugging projects under one account correspond to the same model container.

### Start time
The first startup will take a long time because the system will pull the container's docker image (this process occurs automatically). Please be patient.
